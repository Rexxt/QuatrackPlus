# QuatrackPlus
Patched version of Quatrack that fixes some bugs and implements some features that the original Quatrack doesn't.

The reason this repository exists is because Quatrack is updated extremely sporadically, and some bugs are present in each update, so these bugs don't get fixed for a long time. Plus, Quatrack has some quality of life features that I think are necessary, or at least helpful to have.

## Patches
### 0.6.2.1
* Fixed changing languages causing the game to crash.
* Corrected localizations.
* Added French language pack.
* Warning on crash if running QuatrackPlus.
* Watermark on the top right of the screen if running QuatrackPlus.
* Moved the identity to QuatrackPlus.
* Set the default language to English.
* Changed judgment names.

### 0.6.2.2 (previsional)
* Move some texts around (stats, results...) in order to prevent conflicts.
